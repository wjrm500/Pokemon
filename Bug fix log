1st July
- Fixed fleeing by removing battle_stats Player attribute and replacing with flee_attempts
- Removed "owner" as argument to new starter Pokemon (when lose to Johnson)
- Added deletion of storage directories if no saved data


2nd July
- Noticed bug - when loading game, pokemon are duplicated. Still only one PICKLE file. I think maybe it's something to do with reappending Pokemon objects
to Player party. Does pickling an object pickle sub-objects?
